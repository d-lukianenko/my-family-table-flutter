### 💡About

This is a Flutter demo of **My Family Table**, which I’m also building in Angular. Both versions are still in progress.

### 🚀 Run locally

**1. Clone the repo (or this folder if it's a subproject)**

* git clone https://github.com/d-lukianenko/my-family-table-flutter.git

* cd my-family-table-flutter

**2. Get dependencies**

* flutter pub get

**3. Run the app (choose platform as you like)**

* flutter run


*I run it in the terminal with flutter run (it defaults to Chrome on my setup).*
